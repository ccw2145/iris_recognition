# Iris_recognition
Implemention of iris recognition algorithm from Ma et al., 2003 paper using CASIA Iris Image Database (version 1.0) (CASIA-IrisV1)

To run the code, download the dataset and unzip in the same directory as all other *.py* files  
Go to that directory in terminal, and type

```bash
python IrisRecognition.py
```

IrisRecognition.py contains the main function which uses all other subfunctions and outputs a evaluation of the model, including correct recognition rate (CRR) for the identification mode and ROC curve for verification mode
